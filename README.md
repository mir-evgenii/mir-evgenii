### HelloðŸ‘‹ I am Eugene.

Sometimes I write code. In the main **backend** on **PHP**. I also like to code in **Python**.

In the last project, I wrote a **peer-to-peer messenger** using **WebRTC**.
Users use public PGP keys instead of names.
A [signaling server](https://github.com/mir-evgenii/signaling_server) is used to establish a peer-to-peer connection.
The [messenger client](https://github.com/mir-evgenii/messenger_client_app) supports video and audio calls.
Signal server running in [Docker](https://github.com/mir-evgenii/doc_web_app "docker-compose config").

I also wrote a [simple messenger client](https://github.com/mir-evgenii/messenger_desktop_app) using my signaling server.
