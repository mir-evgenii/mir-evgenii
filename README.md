#### The last projects:

In the [last project](https://github.com/mir-evgenii/note), I was developing a service for sending notes to Telegram. For development I used PHP framework Laravel and Bootstrap. As part of this project, I implemented a web service with authentication, implemented CRUD functions for notes and users, Telegram bot, wrote autotests using Dusk.

Also I wrote a peer-to-peer messenger using WebRTC. Users use public PGP keys instead of names. A [signaling server](https://github.com/mir-evgenii/signaling_server) is used to establish a peer-to-peer connection. The messenger client supports video and audio calls. Signal server running in [Docker](https://github.com/mir-evgenii/doc_web_app).

I also wrote a [simple messenger client](https://github.com/mir-evgenii/messenger_desktop_app) using my signaling server.
